# 📝 Express Quotes API

This is a basic **Express.js** project built as part of my learning journey with Node.js and Express. The goal was to create a functional REST API with endpoints for managing a list of inspirational quotes, and to practice using Express routers, query parameters, and connecting with a basic HTML frontend.
